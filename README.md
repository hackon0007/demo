While questions about GitHub's long term success still remain, Microsoft seems committed to GitHub as a platform and the development community around it.

As a gesture of good will in that direction, Microsoft and GitHub announced major change to their account plans. In the past, GitHub has always allowed unlimited public repositories for all account types. However, the moment you needed a private repository, you had to upgrade to a paid account. This was a major distinction between Github and other serivces (GitLab, BitBucket) - that allowed some level of private repositories for free.

Now, GitHub allows unlimited free private repositories with up to 3 collaborators. This is great news for many solo developers and personal accounts that occasionally need a private repo. Of course, the moment you grow beyond the initial three helpers, you'll still need to pony up for a paid account -- but this is still a major improvement to the GitHub service for the vast majority of us.

The same company that called the open source movement a cancer, now embraces open source and its development community. For example, Visual Studio Code is based upon an open source technology called Electron. Microsoft has been involved with giving back to open source projects like Git, Electron, and many others -- not just using it as a foundation for its products.
